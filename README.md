This java library provides functions that read and convert SPC files.

## Usage


## SPC File Format

The SPC file format is used for storing spectroscopic data. It was invented by a company called Galactic Industries, which was obtained later by Thermo LabSystems.

The SPC file is a binary format file, which contains all data and corresponding configuration information from the instrument that produces the file. As of the binary format, it is not readable in standard text editors.
